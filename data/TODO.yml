TODO:
- Create stats
  - Add to the Fighter class that we have some base stats
  - Change references to Base.Power and Base.Defense to this
    - Strength: Power
    - Dexterity: Defense
    - Constitution: Health
  - Change increases/decreases to these stats as long as it makes sense?
  - Also create an XP counter for each (for now, str_exp, dex_exp, con_exp)
  - When we kill stuff, give us xp based on the gear we have (so go into the Level file/class and add the counter for each; 
    whenever you would gain xp, instead check gear and add)
  - I'll make gear lists (these items are "finesse", this armor is "heavy", etc, that will determine the stat)
- Prettier menus?
  - Currently we're using purely the builtins of TCOD
  - If we can display pretty graphics around the TCOD text that's fine
  - Also needed for cutscenes
- Random monster generation
  - This is a full overhaul so I'll get to it eventually lol
  - Generate a random set of equipment, levels, xp, etc to simulate a player leveling
- Loot drops
  - Monsters should drop loot
    - Materials should be super easy; just player.inventory.materials[i] += whatever
    - Maybe print the gained material
    - items are harder
    - directly adding to inventory maybe?
