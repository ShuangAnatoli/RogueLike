TODO:
- Create stats:
  - Add to the Fighter class that we have some base stats
  - Change references to Base.Power and Base.Defense to this
    - Strength: Power
    - Dexterity: Defense
    - Constitution: Health
  - Change increases/decreases to these stats as long as it makes sense?
  - Also create an XP counter for each (for now, str_exp, dex_exp, con_exp)
  - When we kill stuff, give us xp based on the gear we have (so go into the Level file/class and add the counter for each; 
    whenever you would gain xp, instead check gear and add)
  - I'll make gear lists (these items are "finesse", this armor is "heavy", etc, that will determine the stat)
  - Skills:
    - Instead of just str/dex/con we want all the skills
    - Make downtime actions roll skills
    - Print out d20 rolls maybe
- Menus:
  - Currently we're using purely the builtins of TCOD
  - If we can display pretty graphics around the TCOD text that's fine
  - Also needed for cutscenes

- Loot drops:
  - Monsters should drop loot
    - Materials should be super easy; just player.inventory.materials[i] += whatever
    - Maybe print the gained material
    - items are harder
    - directly adding to inventory maybe?

- Fill out values:
  - Add RNG rolls to attacks that actually matter
  - Crafting should make sense; edit the values
  - Weapons should have dice instead of flat damage
  - Armor should have more interesting values
  - (low prio) Elemental damage

- New Systems:
  - Create crafting
  - Events
  - Dismemberment
    - Cutscene dismemberment - pops up (this will have placeholder art until we either get serious and/or hire an animator)
  - Random monster generation:
    - This is a full overhaul so I'll get to it eventually lol
    - Generate a random set of equipment, levels, xp, etc to simulate a player leveling
